# Handwritten Label AI Assistant Demo

## Slide 1: Introduction & Problem

**Handwritten Label AI Assistant**

- Transforming handwritten label management with AI
- Processes handwritten labels on storage containers and documents
- Extracts text and structured data with high accuracy

**Key Problem We're Solving:**
- Manual processing of handwritten labels is:
  - Time-consuming
  - Error-prone
  - Resource-intensive

        RD[Results Display]
    end

        REV[AI Review]
        STR[Structured Data Extraction]
    end

        GRQ[Groq]
        CLD[Claude]
        OAI[OpenAI]
    end
    
    UI --> UP

    PRE --> OCR
    OCR --> REV
    REV --> STR
    STR --> RD
    
    OCR --> OLL
    OCR -.-> GRQ
    REV -.-> CLD
    REV -.-> OAI

```

- Modern React frontend with responsive UI
- FastAPI Python backend
- Modular architecture with multiple LLM provider support
- Local processing with Ollama + cloud options (Groq, Claude, OpenAI)
